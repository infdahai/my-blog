## Abstract

This work introduces Configured Failure Trapping, a novel backdoor attack task against Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, which aims to activate attacks through stealthy textual triggers and induce configured failure modes. Unlike prior backdoor attacks that treat any task failure as a successful attack, Configured Failure Trapping requires the attacker to control how the robot fails (e.g., causing the robot to grasp with a specified positional offset), making it substantially more challenging and hard to detect. To support the new task, we propose an effective data engine for synthesizing high-quality target trajectories and an automated suite for measuring configured-failure fidelity. Then, based on this foundation, we construct two new benchmarks, namely Trap-LIBERO and Trap-RoboTwin, that instantiate Configured Failure Trapping across four representative failure modes. To address this task, we identify sparse action deviation as a critical challenge and accordingly propose a novel method named TrapVLA, which explicitly learns trigger-induced action residuals to steer the policy toward the configured failure behavior. Extensive experiments across simulation benchmarks and real-world robotic settings show that TrapVLA effectively injects configured failure modes into VLA models while largely preserving performance on clean data.

## TL;DR

This work introduces Configured Failure Trapping, a novel backdoor attack task against Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, which aims to activate attacks through stealthy textual triggers and induce configured failure modes. Unlike prior backdoor attacks that treat any task failure as a successful attack, Configured Failure Trapping requires the attacker to control how the robot fails (e.g., causing the robot to grasp with a specified positional offset), making it substantially more challenging and hard to detect.
